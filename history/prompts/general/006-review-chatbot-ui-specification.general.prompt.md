response_text: "The `spec.md` for `003-docusaurus-chatbot-ui` appears to be complete and covers all the requirements outlined in your initial prompt. It includes detailed sections on overview, architecture, interface, backend communication, integration, testing, acceptance criteria, and edge cases.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating a development plan (`plan.md`) based on this specification, or do you have any modifications or additions you\'d like to make to the specification first?"
outcome: User requested to continue working on the specification. Agent reviewed the existing specification and found it complete based on the initial request, then asked for clarification or to proceed to planning.
