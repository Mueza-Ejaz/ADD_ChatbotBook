command: "AI ROBOTICS WEBSITE REDESIGN - SPECIFIC SECTION REDESIGN PROMPT ## BACKGROUND & CONTEXT: I have three screenshots of an AI Robotics website that needs redesigning. Currently, there are two separate sections that I want to combine into one beautiful, modern web component: 1. Section from Screenshot 1: The \"Master AI Robotics Today\" block that contains promotional content and features list 2. Section from Screenshot 3: The navigation/footer section with Explore, Resources, and Connect links These sections currently exist separately with poor styling. I need them combined into a single, attractive component. ## EXISTING CONTENT TO EXTRACT: ### FROM \"MASTER AI ROBOTICS TODAY\" SECTION: Main Heading: \"Master AI Robotics Today\" Subheading: \"Join thousands of developers and engineers learning cutting-edge robotics technology\" Features List (4 items): Comprehensive tutorials Practical projects Latest AI techniques Community support Call-to-Action: \"Get Free Chapter\" button Note: \"Start learning immediately. No spam. Unsubscribe anytime.\" text ### FROM NAVIGATION/FOOTER SECTION: Explore Category: Getting Started Blog Community Resources Category: API Reference Contribute Connect Category: Twitter GitHub Discord Stack Overflow Copyright: \"Copyright © 2025 AI Robotics Book. Built with Docusaurus.\" ## PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT DESIGN: - These two related sections are separated in the layout - Plain text with no visual appeal - No icons, animations, or modern design elements - Poor visual hierarchy - Looks outdated and unprofessional ## REDESIGN OBJECTIVE: Create a single unified web component that: 1. COMBINES both sections seamlessly 2. REDESIGNS them with modern, attractive styling 3. ADD animations and interactive effects 4. FOLLOWS AI/robotics futuristic theme 5. IS fully responsive ## FINAL COMPONENT CONTENT REQUIREMENTS: ### LEFT SIDE (Main Content Area): - Primary Heading: \"Master AI Robotics Today\" (prominent, eye-catching) - Description: \"Join thousands of developers and engineers learning cutting-edge robotics technology\" - Features List (with icons): - ✅ Comprehensive tutorials (icon: graduation cap) - ✅ Practical projects (icon: project diagram) - ✅ Latest AI techniques (icon: brain) - ✅ Community support (icon: users) - Primary CTA Button: \"Get Free Chapter\" (with hover/click effects) - Small Note Below Button: \"Start learning immediately. No spam. Unsubscribe anytime.\" ### RIGHT SIDE (Navigation Cards Area - 3 Cards Stacked): CARD 1: EXPLORE - Card Title: \"Explore\" (with compass icon) - Links (with icons): - Getting Started (play circle icon) - Blog (blog icon) - Community (users icon) CARD 2: RESOURCES - Card Title: \"Resources\" (with toolbox icon) - Links (with icons): - API Reference (code icon) - Contribute (handshake icon) CARD 3: CONNECT - Card Title: \"Connect\" (with link icon) - Social Media Buttons (circular, with icons): - Twitter (bird icon) - GitHub (cat/octopus icon) - Discord (game controller icon) - Stack Overflow (stack overflow icon) ### FOOTER SECTION (Bottom of Component): - Copyright text: \"Copyright © 2025 AI Robotics Book. Built with Docusaurus.\" ## VISUAL DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS: ### COLOR PALETTE: - Background: Dark futuristic theme (#0c0c1d → #1a1a2e gradient) - Primary Accent Gradient: #00d4ff (cyan) → #6a5af9 (purple) - Secondary Accent: #ff0080 (pink) for highlights - Text Colors: - #e6f1ff (white-blue) for headings - #b0c4de (light blue-gray) for body text - #8fa3c9 (gray-blue) for secondary text - Card Backgrounds: rgba(20, 25, 45, 0.7) semi-transparent dark ### ANIMATIONS & INTERACTIVE EFFECTS: 1. HOVER ANIMATIONS: - Cards lift up (transform: translateY) on hover - Links slide right and change color on hover - Social buttons change to gradient background and lift on hover - CTA button has shine effect (moving gradient overlay) and lifts on hover 2. BORDER & GLOW EFFECTS: - Gradient borders on cards (top border for main card, left border for side cards) - Subtle glowing effects for futuristic feel - Rounded corners (20px for cards, 50px for buttons) 3. PAGE LOAD ANIMATIONS: - Main card fades in from bottom (fadeInUp) - Side cards fade in from right with staggered delay - Floating background elements with continuous animation - Pulsing effect on CTA button 4. CLICK EFFECTS: - Ripple effect on CTA button click (expanding circle) - Interactive feedback for all clickable elements ### LAYOUT STRUCTURE: DESKTOP (≥900px): ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ [Header - Not part of this] │ ├───────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ │ LEFT COLUMN │ RIGHT COLUMN │ │ (70% width) │ (30% width) │ │ │ │ │ • Main title │ • Card 1: Explore │ │ • Description│ • Card 2: Resources │ │ • Features │ • Card 3: Connect │ │ • CTA button │ │ │ • Small note │ │ │ │ │ ├───────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┤ │ Footer with copyright │ └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ text MOBILE (≤900px): ┌─────────────────────┐ │ Main Card │ ├─────────────────────┤ │ Explore Card │ ├─────────────────────┤ │ Resources Card │ ├─────────────────────┤ │ Connect Card │ ├─────────────────────┤ │ Footer │ └─────────────────────┘ ### ICONS REQUIRED (FontAwesome 6.4.0): - Features Icons: fa-graduation-cap, fa-project-diagram, fa-brain, fa-users - Card Title Icons: fa-compass, fa-toolbox, fa-link - Link Icons: fa-play-circle, fa-blog, fa-users, fa-code, fa-handshake - Social Icons: fa-twitter, fa-github, fa-discord, fa-stack-overflow - Header Icon: fa-robot (for logo, if included) ## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS: 1. Single HTML File: Complete code in one HTML file 2. Responsive Design: Using CSS Grid and Flexbox 3. External Resources: Only FontAwesome CDN allowed 4. Browser Compatibility: Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge 5. Code Quality: Clean, commented, organized code 6. Performance: Optimized animations using transform/opacity 7. Accessibility: Semantic HTML, proper contrast ratios ## DELIVERABLE EXPECTATIONS: Provide complete HTML code that: 1. Creates a beautiful, unified component combining both sections 2. Implements all specified animations and effects 3. Is fully responsive and mobile-friendly 4. Matches the AI/robotics futuristic theme 5. Can be copied and used immediately The final design should look premium, modern, and suitable for an AI/robotics educational platform, with smooth animations and attractive visual elements that engage users. IMPORTANT: Do not include any content from the screenshots that I didn't specify (like the \"Activate Windows\" messages, duplicate copyrights, or other sections). Focus ONLY on combining and redesigning the two specific sections mentioned above.ye mainy jo apko instructions di hy apply karny ko is sy baqi wali jo ui ai hy wo effected na hoo or han aik chnages kar k phely mujhsy pooch ly k me satisfy hoto agr me kaho yes to ap agy barhy warna agr no kaho to chnages ko remove kardy"
