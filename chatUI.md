You are a senior frontend UI/UX engineer.

Task:
Redesign and improve the existing chatbot UI used inside my robotics book website.

Context:
- The chatbot is already integrated but currently looks broken and unfinished.
- The chat window has no proper UI, no visible input field, poor spacing, and no visual hierarchy.
- This is a robotics / AI themed book, so the chatbot must match a futuristic robotics design.

What you need to do:
1. Design a modern chatbot UI with a professional robotics/AI theme.
2. Create a clearly visible input field at the bottom where users can type prompts.
3. Add a Send button with hover and active effects.
4. Improve the chat container with:
   - Rounded borders
   - Soft shadow / glow effect
   - Proper padding and spacing
5. Style chat messages:
   - User messages on the right (different background color)
   - AI messages on the left (robotic/futuristic color)
6. Use a clean color palette:
   - Dark blue / black background
   - Neon blue / cyan / purple accents
7. Add smooth animations:
   - Message fade-in or slide animation
   - Button hover transitions
8. Make the chatbot responsive for desktop and mobile.
9. Do NOT change backend logic — only improve HTML, CSS, and minimal JS if needed.
10. Keep the design minimal, readable, and professional (no childish UI).

Deliverables:
- Updated HTML structure (if needed)
- Complete CSS for chatbot UI
- Optional small JS improvements for interaction (focus, animation)

Goal:
The chatbot should look like a premium AI assistant used in a robotics book, not a raw or broken UI.

Proceed step-by-step and clearly explain what files you are modifying and why.

Important Tip:
Follow best UI/UX practices used in modern AI chat interfaces (like ChatGPT-style layout).
